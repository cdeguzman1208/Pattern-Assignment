# Pattern-Assignment

## Requirements:
- Create a system that generates a repeating patterns using <ins>**more than one algorithm**</ins> (does not need to be one shown in class)
  - *Examples include Noise (Perlin/Simplex), Cellular Automata, Autonomous Agents, Point Distribution, Voronoi, and more.*
- This pattern should be either repeating (near-infinite) -or- update over time (cellular automata)
  - Perlin for instance is near-infinite, and cellular automata or agents are by their nature updating over time
- The viewer should be able to influence the pattern, either before generation or during generation
- This pattern can be visual, auditory, data, or multimedia as long as you can share multiple example outputs
